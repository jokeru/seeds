## Ikigai

**Ikigai** (pronounced ee-key-guy) is a Japanese concept that essentially means *a reason for being*.  

It's made from two Japanese words:  
- `iki` meaning *life*  
- `kai` meaning *effect, result, worth or benefit*  
Combined: **a reason for living**

**Ikigai** is the union point of four fundamental components of life:  
- passion  
- vocation  
- profession  
- mission  

In other words, where:  
- what you love meets  
- what you are good at meets  
- what you can be valued and paid for meets  
- that which the world needs
