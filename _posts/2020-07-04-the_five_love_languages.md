## the Five Love Languages

- words of affirmation
- quality time
- giving gifts
- acts of service
- physical touch

The most powerful thing we can do for another person is to choose to love them in their own language, over a long period of time, unconditionally, no matter how they respond.

> _Gary Chapman_
