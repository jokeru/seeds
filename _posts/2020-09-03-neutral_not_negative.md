## Negativity

Negativity is 4x - 7x more powerful than positivity.  

Saying something out loud is 10x more powerful than thinking it.  

#### So

Your negative talk is **40x - 70x** more powerful than your positive thoughts !  
* Don't verbalise negativity !  
* Don't think and say negative things !  

## Go Neutral

Use neutral based thinking - truth based on facts, not on what could happen.  

Choose to be part of the x% that made it, don't let your past predict your future.
