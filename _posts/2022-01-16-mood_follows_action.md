## Mood Follows Action

If you're waiting until you feel like doing something, chances are you're probably never going to get to it.  
Take the action despite how you feel about it.  

You can't think your way into the mood that you seek, or the state of mind that you aspire to and have it.  
Action is the only thing that can trigger that changed state.
