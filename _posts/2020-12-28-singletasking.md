## SingleTasking (or MonoTasking)

Do one thing at a time.  
And do it well.  

Multitasking is a myth. Multitasking is just context switching. Each of those switches takes a toll with researchers saying you lose 20% of your overall productivity for each task you try to take on at once. And you & your body get more stressed.  

### Here's the drill

#### distractions off
- phone, apps, tabs, music, everything must be off / out of sight

### baby steps
- start small (5 min) but do set a timer and stick to it
- increase - you can use the Pomodoro technique
- now you can focus for hours

#### break on
- end each task with a real break, no screens involved
- get out, move your body
