## May the FORCE be with You

The FORCE is coming from cognitive distortions (ways that our mind convinces us of something that isn't really true), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

| State | Self | F | O | R | C | E |
| ----- | ---- | - | - | - | - | - |
| Negative | Anti-Self | fortune-telling | overgeneralising | rigidity | confusion | emotional reasoning |
| Positive (the Antidote) | Best-Self | fact-finding | objective thinking | relaxation | clarified purpose | evidence-based reasoning |

Before making a decision, make sure to check the filter you’re using to assess the situation.  
If it falls under the negative force, use the corresponding acronym to break out of that mental loop.

### Scenario
Let's say that today I _should_ go out and do my run, but I don't really feel like doing it, I start considering _tapping out_ and skipping it.  
I'm also asking myself: why do I even bother running?  

If I scan the negative FORCEs, I can see there is a *confusion* on why I run.  
In order to flip it, I need to  *clarify the purpose* or running: I do it for my health, for the endorphins and all the other good stuff that comes with a physical activity.

So maybe I don't really want to skip it after all !

#### Bonus, unrelated
Trust in GOD - Good Orally Direction (a good advice).
