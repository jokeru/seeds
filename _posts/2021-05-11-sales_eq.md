## Sales EQ

- make the client feel good, unconsciously he'll want to reciprocate that feeling back to you
- avoid cognitive dissonance: don't challenge your client's current choice, he'll get defensive; instead ask him what he likes about it (the negativity bias will kick in and he'll be laying out the negativesÂ as well)
- use empathy to help the client navigate their current emotional challenge, get in their shoes and don't stretch them too much with your offer
- stay on top of your emotions, fight / flight makes you switch off your thinking brain and the monkey brain isn't enough to get the deal
