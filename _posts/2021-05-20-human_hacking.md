## Human Hacking

### profiling

Q1: In social encounters - are you people oriented or results focused?  
Q2: In conversations - are you direct or indirect?  

Direct + Results = D or I  
Social + Indirect = S or C  

**DISC**:  
- **D**ominant - confident, results oriented  
- **I**nfluencers - enthusiastic collaborators  
- **S**incere - calm and supportive  
- **C**onscieuntious - organised and factual  

Profile yourself first, then you can profile others so you can speak their language.  

### pretexting

The art of the start - create effective pretexts to skew conversations to your advantage.  

**PREPARE**:  
- clarify the **P**roblem you want to solve  
- and the **R**esult you seek  
- consider the **E**motional atmosphere you intend the conversation to have  
- and the **P**rovocation on your part to generate those emotions  
- once all clear, **A**ctivate your pretext, give it a form  
- decide how to **R**ender your pretext: when, where, how you'll approach the subject  
- **E**valuate if all this will leave the subject in a better position  

### build rapport (releases oxytocin)
Couple ways:  
- provide a pretext and invent an artificial time limit: can I bother your for 2 minutes, I'm new to the area and I'm looking for a good restaurant  
- offer personal information about you that the subject can relate to  
- place the other in a position of authority (like asking for an advice)  

### principles of influence

Reciprocation for eg - offer something valuable, and the favour will be returned.  

Place yourself in a position of authority & knowledge and you'll earn their trust.  

Elicitation (get the information you want without asking):  
- state a reported fact (I've read that ...)  
- make false statements, you'll be corrected (people born in Feb like to eat strawberries)  

### body language
- open ventrals
- mirroring (if you smile, the other one will mirror you)
