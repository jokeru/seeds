## Human Hacking

### profiling

Q1: In social encounters - are you people oriented or results focused?  
Q2: In conversations - are you direct or indirect?  

Direct + Results = D or I  
Social + Indirect = S or C  

DISC:
- **D**ominant - confident, results oriented  
- **I**nfluencers - enthisiastic collaboralters
- **S**incere - calm and supportive
- **C**onscieuntious - organised and factual  

Profile yourself first, then you can profile others so you can speak their language.  

### pretexting
The art of the start - create effective pretexts to skew conversations to your advantage.  
PREPARE:  
- clarify the **P**roblem you want to solve  
- and the **R**esult you seek  
- consider the **E**motional atmosphere you intend the conversation to have  
- and the **P**rovocation on your part to generate those emotions  
- once all clear, **A**ctivate your pretext, give it a form  
- decide how to **R**ender your pretext: when, where, how you'll approach the subject  
- **E**valuate if all this will leave the subject in a better position  

### build rapport
(release oxitocine) with others
- place the other in a position of authority

- principle of influence

- elicitation - get the information you want without asking
