## the Eisenhower Matrix
or The Time Management Matrix, The Eisenhower Box, The Eisenhower Method, and The Urgent-Important Matrix.

Are you always busy and don't know what to do first?  
Too much on your plate? Wanna be more productive ?

### Easy

| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|-|--------|------------|
| **Important** | Do it now | Schedule it |
| **Not Important** | Delegate it | Delete it |

If you don't use the matrix, you are more likely to prioritize tasks with a deadline over tasks without one regardless of their long-term payoffs (the "Mere-Urgency Effect").  

So be wise, take the red pill :)
