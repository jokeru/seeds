## NVC
NonViolent Communication contains 4 basic components:

### [O]bservations
Objectively observing the situation - without evaluation, blame or moralistic judgement 

### [F]eelings
Identifying the feelings that the situation brings up

### [N]eeds
Connect with the need that is not being met - you could use [The 16 Basic Desires]({% post_url 2020-10-02-the_16_basic_desires %}) model

### [R]equests
Make a request that would better meet your needs

#### Example

I noticed youâ€™ve been late 3 times a week and last week (observation).  
I feel anxious (feeling) because we need to meet our deadlines (need).  
Do you need a few days off to sort out personal matters at home (request)?
